## Transaction Bulk Upload ##
* Load the file from the folder within the app /doc/test-upload.csv
* There is still issues with the uploading, some amounts and dates are not being formatted and hence show as blank.
* Validations on the transactions model are still commented out, they are killing the file upload at the moment

## Transaction To Do ##
* Maybe validate that use has entered a date on the model as well, kind of duplicates above

## Start to think about users > groups > transactions ##

## Zassmin steps ##
* Install Postgres and MySql at the machine level using Brew

## App next steps ##
* User needs to be able to create (and edit) personal details. Needs to be a wizard type deal on sign in for this.
* Need to deploy to Zassmin's Heroku account.
